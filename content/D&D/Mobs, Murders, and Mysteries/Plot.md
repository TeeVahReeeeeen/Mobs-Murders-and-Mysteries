# The story so far
- [[Donovan Clay|Donovan]], [[Shagworth Boombastic|Shagworth]], and [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar]] met each other attending [[Travelling Circus|a travelling carnival]] in [[Lagoon Hold]].
- After getting to know each other a little and enjoying some time at the circus, they ended up entering a tent that was supposed to be for dice and card games, but instead found themselves in an escape room.
- [[Ulzajahr (Youie)]] had set up the room to find trustworthy people. He informed the party that [[Travelling Circus|the circus]] had been hosting some dodgy dealings with shady individuals, and that he wanted to put an end to it.
- [[Donovan Clay|Donovan]] and [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar]] witnessed these shady activities that night. By morning, [[Ulzajahr (Youie)|Youie]] had been killed, and his tent reduced to a crime scene.
- Before his death, [[Ulzajahr (Youie)|Youie]] had instructed the party to speak to a [[Tabatha|tabaxi acrobat]] at the circus' next location, but the party decided to seek her out before that.
- After meeting [[Tabatha|Tabby]], the party learns that they should seek to be trained by the [[Gnomes of the Knolls]].
- Before they get the chance, the party is ambushed by the [[Circus bodyguard]] and left for dead.
- They wake up in [[West Elm#Gnomes of the Knolls Hideout 1|a peaceful area of woods]] surrounded by gnomes who introduce themselves as the [[Gnomes of the Knolls]] that [[Tabatha]] told us about.
- They offer to train us, and we learn their ultimate goal is to restore the full power of magic to the world
- After some training, [[Gnomes of the Knolls| the Gnomes]] request that the party head to a nearby town to headhunt for their cause.

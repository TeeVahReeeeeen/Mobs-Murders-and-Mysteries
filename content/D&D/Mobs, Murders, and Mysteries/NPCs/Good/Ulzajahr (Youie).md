Jolly wizard with a lovely white beard

He set up the "escape room" in [[Travelling Circus|the circus]] because he wanted to find trustworthy people. He's been with the carnival for years but he can't help but notice some dodgy dealings going on from within. He is as morally grey as any crazy wizard man could be at his old age, but recently the dodgy dealings have become more of an issue for him. 


Alluded to "some real bad stuff" at the circus's next location (near [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar's]] hometown).

Introduced us to [[Tabatha|Tabby]]. Told us to speak to her at the [[Travelling Circus#Second location - Towards West Elm|next circus location]]

"Youie had too many drinks, they always have a party after hours, something got into the lion and it ate Youie"



### Notes
- He gave us some magic items, but can't offer much more than this.
	- Broach of shielding for [[Donovan Clay|Donovan]]
	- Good luck stone thingy for [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar]] (x2)
	- Cloak for [[Shagworth Boombastic|Shagworth]]
- ==Youie is dead==
- He was a drinker. "mixed his potions" - anything to keep himself jolly.
- ==Has a friend in the east that he was going to send his chest full of magic items==.

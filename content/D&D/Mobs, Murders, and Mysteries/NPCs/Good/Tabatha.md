### Description
A younger (teen) tabaxi lady with well groomed fur, nice silks and sashes tied around her wrist and legs. She is quite skilled at her acrobatics, but her performance seems a little off - only just making a jump, lights looking more ominous than mystical, etc. She looks out to the crowd for someone, worried.

### Notes
- Tabby was raised in the circus by [[Ulzajahr (Youie)|Youie]].
- She says the elves have been hard to keep on her side. 
	Told us that they give the ringleader "incentive" (money probably)
- Her "dad" is a green dragon that hordes cats.
- Trained by the [[Gnomes of the Knolls]]. 
- Wants some reorganisation of the power balance, a deal with the fey
	wants to make magic back to what it once was, same as [[Gnomes of the Knolls|GotK]].
- She was also attacked by the circus at the same time as the party

A centaur, but not in the traditional sense. More like Bojack Horseman.
He is an artist with the penname "==Art,-ist. Man:)=="

He is mysterious, has ties to the [[Feywilds]]. Seems more powerful/influential than he lets on. 



### Notes
- Beat [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar]] at arm wrestling.
- Encountered [[Shagworth Boombastic|Shagworth]] in the [[Feywilds]], where he seemed to grant Shagworth his troupe of pixies (along with some very homoerotic vibes)

A group of mainly gnomes (misfits from [[Feywilds]]) working for the nature and gods of our realm. They seek to restore magic to the world.

First met in [[West Elm#Gnomes of the Knolls Hideout 1|a peaceful area of woods between West Elm and Marshes of McMournful]], they took us there after we lost a fight to the [[Circus bodyguard]].

They have recruited us to venture to [[Marshes of McMournful#Giggleswick|Giggleswick]] to headhunt for more people to join the cause

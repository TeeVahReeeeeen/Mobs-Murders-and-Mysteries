# Gnomes of the Knolls Hideout 1
[[Gnomes of the Knolls|The Gnomes]] have many hideouts, but this is the first one that the party arrived at. 

- A peaceful area of woods with tents set up in a circle facing a larger tent
	- Larger tent has 2 stories, it hosts puzzles mostly
- There is a bench in the woods that is a fairy circle, transporting users to [[Feywilds]]
	This is where [[Shagworth Boombastic|Shagworth]] got his Troupe of Pixies from [[Haymitch]].

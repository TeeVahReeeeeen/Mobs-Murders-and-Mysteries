## First location - [[Lagoon Hold]]
- Circus has U shaped seats around the central stage
- When [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar]] and [[Donovan Clay|Donovan]] returned to the circus at night, shady activities were underway.
- Second day, the tent is gone and there are people looking around
	- Remnants of a crime scene:
		- blood
		- scuff marks
		- patches of grass unearthed
		- signs of struggle
		- investigators around
	- [[Marvelous|Ringleader]] diverts investigators' attention towards circus tent rather than tent #1 
	- ==[[Ulzajahr (Youie)|Youie]] is dead
	- Unknown to [[Donovan Clay|Donovan]], but police has "==Donny - very tall man==" written (Krugar acting suspicious)
	- [[Unimportant NPCs|CPGB]] was very unhappy when [[Donovan Clay|Donovan]] asked about a tabaxi
		- Don wrote "kick me in my dumb pants" on the back of his shirt, which Krugar did.
	- [[Shagworth Boombastic|Shagworth]] spots elf going to living quarters tent and pulling circus performer after them. Shouting at them, probably about the crime.


## Second location - Towards [[West Elm]]
- near [[Krugar Thawl|Krugar's]] hometown

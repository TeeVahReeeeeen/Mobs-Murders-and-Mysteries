Krugar successfully kicked CPGB in the bollocks, then located the tabaxi and promptly picked her up

Tabaxi is called Tabby (tabatha)

People see us leaving with tabby, staff take note of who she was with

Tabby was raised in the circus by youie.

She says the elves have been hard to keep on her side. They give the ringleader “incentive” (money probably).

Don revealed his metal arm and glass eye to everyone.

Tabby’s “dad” is a green dragon that had a horde of cats

We are currently in Lagoon hold, circus is heading towards West Elm

Marsh created Marsh’s McMournful. All marshes are named after her.

The mob at the circus works with faries. The group tabby has been told to look for works with the nature and gods of our realm instead. There’s a large group of mainly gnomes (misfits from feywilds) have come to an agreement that the shady elf works and hiding of magic needs to be stopped.

Tabby wants our help getting to this group. Haymitch contacted tabby in hopes that her horde could help the cause. The elves have made deals with her father before, but if she could persuade him theres’ another way then he could help an uprising of sorts.

Youie was a drinker and “mixed his potions” - anything to keep himself jolly.

“Gnomes of the knolls” trained her and can train us.

Tabby wants some reorganisation of power balance, a deal with the fay. Magic was free once and gods were more free with their power. They want to make magic back to what it once was.

The ringleader is called Marvelous (Marv for short). He has “gone too far to come back out the other end”.

Youie had a friend in the east that he was going to send his chest full of magic items. “There was someone who could help”… the quest who he sent his chest to after his death.

Shagstagram is from Zedett, an oasis in the Drypond desert. It is reasonably wealthy, becoming autocratic.

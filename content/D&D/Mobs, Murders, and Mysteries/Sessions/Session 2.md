Circus: U shape around the central stage

Shaggy loves fairies (and can smell them??)

Lady tabaxi - younger (teen), well groomed fur, nice silks and sashes tied around her wrist and legs. Quite skilled. Performance seems a little off - only just makes a jump, lights look more ominous than mystical, etc. Looks out at the crowd for someone, worried.

Krugar picks up 3 people and drops a child. Shenanigans ensue

Did some dope ass poses with the shagster

Elf named Aldwyn, speaking to the fairy

Bought everyone a water gun, Shagster a wooden puzzle, myself a clockwork clock, and remaining tokens on sweets and a balloon sword (with all 100 of my tokens)

When we return to the circus at night, shady activity is undergoing

Sleeping in 6B, don and krugar in hayloft

(6B is bed bath bar barn breakfast and beyond?)

Day 2, tent #1 has gone. People looking around. From the other side of the river, I can see the remnants of a crime scene: blood, scuff marks, patches of grass unearthed, signs of struggle, investigators around. Ringmaster persuades investigators towards circus tent rather than tent #1

The crime: “youie had too many drinks, they always have a party after hours, something got into the lion and it ate youie”

==Unknown to Donovan, but police has “donny - very tall man” written==

“==the elves are after you==” - goblin that attacked us

There are elves involved in criminal ways who may have been involved in the goblins attacking us and the circus. Some mobs have elves in higherup positions

Made a friend named twoie, meeting them next Wednesday.

Shagbert sucks at everything

Krugar lost to haymitch at armwrestling??

Circus is sullen and gloomy

Speaking to circuspants greasebowl (Guy Fawkes). He was very unhappy when I asked about a tabaxi. I wrote “kick me in my dumb pants” on the back of his shirt.

Shagtastic spots elf going to living quarters tent and pulling circus performer after them. Shouting at them, probably about the crime.

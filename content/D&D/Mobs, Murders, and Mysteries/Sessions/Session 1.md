 ==He set up the room because he wants to find trustworthy people. He’s been with the carnival for years but he can’t help but notice some dodgy dealings going on from within. The carnival itself is harmless but there is a mob of elves who used as a cover to get their wares to where they need to be, have meetings in tents nobody can see during the day, and generally to do risky business. While our wizard friend is morally grey as any crazy wizard man could be at his old age, it’s only recently that this has become more of a displeasing thing over time. It used to be every now and then we’d have one or two elves come pick up a parcel or come tell the ringmaster where to go next, that there’d be something/one waiting there, but over the years it’s really taken over. The craftsmanship of the carnival and circus is really more of a way to hide what’s underneath and some people who could really do damage given the opportunity. One of these evil people was steve, who was really a bodyguard. There to keep people quiet. Shifty business coming that attracts more shifty business. He gives us some items that could help us.==

Next town, there is some real bad stuff. It is near Krugar’s hometown

Youie can’t offer much more than what’s in the chest.
